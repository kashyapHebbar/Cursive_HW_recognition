# Cursive Handwriting Recognition: A Deep Learning Approach

This project presents a robust Cursive Handwriting Recognition system powered by Deep Learning techniques. It implements a comprehensive model that has been trained on a diverse dataset to accurately recognize handwritten text from images.

## Project Description

Handwriting recognition has always been a challenging task due to the variability and complexity of cursive handwriting. This project successfully overcomes these challenges by leveraging deep learning algorithms to learn from a comprehensive dataset, improving the accuracy of handwriting recognition significantly.

Users can simply upload an image containing cursive handwriting through our intuitive user interface, and the system will process and recognize the text written in the image.

## Features

* Deep Learning model for handwriting recognition
* User-friendly interface for image upload
* Ability to accurately recognize cursive handwriting from images
* Training and test sets for model training and validation

## Tools and Libraries Used

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow/Keras - for implementing the deep learning model
* OpenCV - for image processing tasks
* Flask - for setting up the web-based user interface (if used)

## Installation & Usage

Instructions on how to install and run your code. For example:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kashyapHebbar/Cursive_HW_recognition.git
```

## How It Works

The user uploads an image containing handwritten text via the user interface. This image is then preprocessed and passed through our trained deep learning model. The model interprets the handwriting and outputs the recognized text.

## Future Work

Future enhancements may include expanding the capabilities of the system to recognize more diverse handwriting styles and languages, and improving the user interface for a more seamless user experience.

## Acknowledgements

This project utilizes the power of deep learning provided by TensorFlow/Keras libraries, and the efficient image processing capabilities of OpenCV.
